# Development Process Outline

# Backend (Express, Node.js, MongoDB):
Set up a Node.js and Express.js server.
Configure connection to a MongoDB database.
Create models for User, Court, and Review with appropriate fields.
Implement user authentication and authorization (possibly with JWT or Passport.js). 
Create RESTful routes for User, Court, and Review resources (CRUD operations).


# Frontend (React):
Set up a React application.
Implement routing (using React Router).
  **Create components:**
  Navbar component
  Home component
  Login/Signup component (with form validation)
  Implement geolocation functionality (using a service like Google Maps API).
  Discover component (display a list/map of courts, with geolocation)
  Court detail component (show detailed court info and reviews, star feature, add review button)
  Add Court component (form to add a new court with geolocation)
  Add Review component (form to add a new review)
  Profile component (show user's personal info, submitted courts, and reviews) 
  User Authentication:
  Implement user registration and login on the backend (hashed password storage).
  Create frontend forms for registration and login.
  Add state management for current users.
  Implement protected routes (users can only add a court or review when logged in).

# Styling:
Style all components using CSS (you may use a library like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for easier styling).
Make the application responsive to different screen sizes.

# Testing:
Test backend routes using a tool like Postman.
Unit test frontend components (using React Testing Library or similar).
Perform integration and end-to-end testing.
Test the application on different devices and browsers.

# Deployment:
Deploy the backend (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
Deploy the frontend (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
Set up a custom domain name.
