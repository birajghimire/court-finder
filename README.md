# court-finder

Court Finder is a user-centric, geolocation-based web application designed to foster a community of basketball enthusiasts. Using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, it aims to address the common difficulty of finding and sharing information about local basketball courts.

The application will have two key functions. Firstly, it will leverage geolocation data to help users discover nearby basketball courts that may not be widely known or listed elsewhere. This information will be represented in a user-friendly interface, using React.js for a streamlined, intuitive user experience.

The second key function will be its interactive platform. Users will be able to add previously unfound local basketball courts to the platform's database, providing a wealth of shared knowledge about available courts and their characteristics. This fosters a sense of community as users collectively contribute to the platform, making it a useful resource for anyone seeking to play basketball locally.

In terms of security and data management, Court Finder is currently using MongoDB for robust user authentication, ensuring user data is securely managed and their contributions correctly attributed. The backend operations are efficiently being handled using Express.js, ensuring fast, seamless data retrieval and updating.

Through Court Finder, users will not not only be able to discover new places to play but also contribute to a growing, shared resource for their local basketball community. It is a testament to the power of interactive, community-based web applications in enriching local sporting experiences

# Development Process Outline

# Backend (Express, Node.js, MongoDB):
Set up a Node.js and Express.js server.
Configure connection to a MongoDB database.
Create models for User, Court, and Review with appropriate fields.
Implement user authentication and authorization (possibly with JWT or Passport.js). 
Create RESTful routes for User, Court, and Review resources (CRUD operations).


# Frontend (React):
Set up a React application.
Implement routing (using React Router).
  **Create components:**
  Navbar component
  Home component
  Login/Signup component (with form validation)
  Implement geolocation functionality (using a service like Google Maps API).
  Discover component (display a list/map of courts, with geolocation)
  Court detail component (show detailed court info and reviews, star feature, add review button)
  Add Court component (form to add a new court with geolocation)
  Add Review component (form to add a new review)
  Profile component (show user's personal info, submitted courts, and reviews) 
  User Authentication:
  Implement user registration and login on the backend (hashed password storage).
  Create frontend forms for registration and login.
  Add state management for current users.
  Implement protected routes (users can only add a court or review when logged in).

# Styling:
Style all components using CSS (you may use a library like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for easier styling).
Make the application responsive to different screen sizes.

# Testing:
Test backend routes using a tool like Postman.
Unit test frontend components (using React Testing Library or similar).
Perform integration and end-to-end testing.
Test the application on different devices and browsers.

# Deployment:
Deploy the backend (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
Deploy the frontend (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
Set up a custom domain name.
